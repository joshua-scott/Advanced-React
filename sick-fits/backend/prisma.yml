# Notes:
# The post-deploy hook isn't working right now for some reason.
# So I need to use graphql-cli directly.
# Updating prisma might fix it but I want to be on the same version as Wes so the course goes smoothly.
# That's why the endpoint is hardcoded here and not (only) in the .env file

# endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
endpoint: https://eu1.prisma.sh/joshua-scott-37c39a/sick-fits/dev
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
# secret: ${env:PRISMA_SECRET}
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - graphql get-schema -p prisma
